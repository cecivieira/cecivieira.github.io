        <p>I am a librarian who loves to work with data and information, but a few years ago I wanted to expand my
            action beyond a traditional library. This is how I started my forays into technology, looking for a new
            professional passion.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This path has been built collectively, through technology communities, especially those whose axes are
            "diversity and inclusion", in addition to being guided by the "open source" and "hacker" culture.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Learning software development in this welcoming and collaborative environment makes the trip more pleasant,
            while allowing me to contribute to projects with a social impact, such as "Querido Di√°rio" (Open Knowledge
            Brazil), where I was a data analyst, and with the event organization, such as the "Python Brasil" conference
            and the "Women in Data Science Valencia (ES)".</p>
        <br>
        <p>Being a speaker is one of my greatest satisfactions as a content creator. Being able to share there,
            instantly, about a technical topic that I'm passionate about and making exchanges on the subject is
            something, in fact, very rewarding. I find the same satisfaction being on the instructor teams at the School
            of Data and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-formacao-basica">LinkedIn Learning</a>, where
            I facilitate classes on courses, mainly about Python tools.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Sharing my learning is how I contribute to the professional training of others and return to the communities
            what I receive. This blog was born with that purpose, to record what I have learned along the way and to
            provide free information that may be useful to someone else.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Currently, I am on the team of the <a href="http://pizzadedados.com/">Pizza de Dados podcast</a>, the first
            and most beloved Brazilian podcast about data science. A project that aims to contribute to technological
            and data literacy in Portuguese, and of which I am very proud to be a part.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On data transparency field, I'm an ambassador of the "Data Science for Citizen Innovation" project
            of Open Knowledge Brazil and manager of the Open Data Portal of UFPE.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My professional performance in these collaborative spaces carries with it the feminist and anti-racist
            activism that are the cornerstones of my civic education. And so, I contribute my grain of sand while
            changing my world.</p>
